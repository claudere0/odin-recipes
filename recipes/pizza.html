    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>warm water</li>
      <li>granulated sugar</li>
      <li>instant yeast</li>
      <li>all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

	      <p><strong>Prepare the Dough</strong></p>
        <p>The dough is made by mixing flour, yeast, water, 
salt, and olive oil, then kneading it until it's smooth 
and elastic. The dough is then covered and set aside to 
rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, which 
usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour and a half, 
depending on the temperature and type of yeast.</p>
	      <ul>
          <li><em>Tip:</em> You can also buy pre-made dough
from a grocery store for a quicker option.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong></p>
        <p>For a crispy crust, preheat your oven to the highest
possible temperature (around 450-550°F or 230-290°C) for at
least 30 minutes, preferably with a pizza stone or an upturned
heavy baking sheet inside. High heat is key to achieving 
a good texture.</p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Shape the Dough</strong></p>
        <p>Once risen, punch the dough down to release the air, 
and divide it into portions (one pound of dough usually makes 
two 10-12 inch pizzas). On a lightly floured surface, use your
hands or a rolling pin to flatten and stretch the dough into
a circle, leaving the edges slightly thicker for the crust.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Add Toppings</strong></p>
        <p>Transfer the shaped dough to a pizza peel or baking
sheet dusted with cornmeal or flour. Spread a thin layer of 
sauce evenly over the base, leaving a small border for the 
crust. Add your desired toppings and sprinkle with cheese.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Tip:</em> Avoid overloading the pizza with 
          too many toppings, as this can make the crust soggy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Bake the Pizza</strong></p>
        <p>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone 
or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 8–15 minutes, or until 
the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling.
        </p>
      </li>

      
      <li><p><strong>Serve</strong></p>
        <p>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few 
minutes, then slice and enjoy.
        </p>
