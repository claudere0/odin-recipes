    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>For the Patties:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 lb (450g) ground chicken (a mix of white and dark 
meat is juicier)</li>
          <li>¼ cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>½ small onion, finely minced or grated</li>
          <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten (acts as a binder)</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (or ½ tsp garlic powder)</li>
          <li>½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp olive or vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>For Assembly:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
          <li>Mayonnaise, ketchup, or a preferred sauce</li>
          <li>Lettuce leaves, tomato and onion slices (optional)</li>
          <li>4 slices cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>

      <li>
	      <p><strong>Prepare the Mixture</strong></p>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, breadcrumbs, 
minced onion, beaten egg, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix 
until just combined, being careful not to overmix, which can make 
the patties tough.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Shape the Patties</strong></p>
        <p>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them 
into patties, about ½ to ¾ inch thick. Press a shallow indent into 
the center of each with your thumb to help them cook evenly and 
prevent puffing up.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Cook the Patties</strong></p>
        <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet or a grill pan over 
medium-high heat. Place the chicken patties in the hot pan and cook 
for 4-6 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. The 
internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C). If adding cheese, 
place a slice on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking 
and cover briefly to melt.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Toast the Buns</strong></p>
        <p>While the patties cook, lightly toast the hamburger buns 
on the grill or in a separate pan until golden and warm.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li><p><strong>Assemble the Burger</strong></p>
        <p>Spread your chosen sauce (mayo, ketchup, etc.) on the 
bottom half of each toasted bun. Add a layer of lettuce and tomato 
slices (if using), then top with a chicken patty. Place the top 
bun on and serve immediately.
        </p>
