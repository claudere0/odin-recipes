      </li>
      <li>½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp black pepper, or to taste

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>First, you will need 1 lb (450g) of boneless, skinless 
chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces, ½ cup of all-purpose 
flour, 2 large eggs lightly beaten, 1 cup of breadcrumbs (panko 
is a good choice for crispiness), ½ tsp of salt, ¼ tsp of black 
pepper, and vegetable or olive oil for cooking.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>To start the process, set up a simple breading station 
using three shallow bowls. In the first bowl, combine the flour 
with salt and pepper. In the second bowl, place the beaten eggs. 
In the third bowl, add your breadcrumbs. You may add extra 
seasonings like paprika or garlic powder to the breadcrumbs at 
this stage if you wish.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>Next, coat the chicken pieces one by one. Dip each 
piece into the flour first, shaking off any excess. Then, dip 
it into the egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. 
Finally, coat the piece thoroughly in the breadcrumbs, pressing 
gently to ensure they adhere well to the chicken.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>Once all the chicken pieces are coated, you can choose 
your cooking method. If you prefer to pan-fry, heat about half an 
inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully 
add the nuggets in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, and fry 
for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until golden brown and fully cooked 
through.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>Alternatively, you can bake them. Preheat your oven 
to 400°F (200°C) and place the breaded chicken pieces on a lined 
baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, making sure to flip 
them halfway through, until they are golden and the chicken is 
fully cooked internally.
        </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>Finally, transfer the cooked nuggets to a paper 
towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil (if fried) and serve 
them warm with your favorite dipping sauces like ketchup, barbecue 
sauce, or honey mustard.
        </p>
